# Physochlaina_orientalis
Scripts used during the assembly and analysis of P. orientalis mitochondrial genome

The scripts posted here were used to analyze the mitochondrial genome of the Solanaceae Phyoschlaina orientalis. Scripts are more a combination of different programs than a program itself. So you need to check you have installed all pre-requisites in your path before running them. If you used them please cite: "XXX"  

1- Calculate contig read depth

2- Get a subset of reads

3- Get a subset of reads for SSAKE extension (deleting plastidial reads)

4- Get repeats and cluster them using VSEARCH

5- Get frequency of recombination across repeats
